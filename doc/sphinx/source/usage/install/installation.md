**ModelOrderReduction setup**
^^^

You can either build it from the [source](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/ModelOrderReduction) as explained [here](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/plugins/build-a-plugin-from-sources/) with SOFA.
Or take the binaries generated [here](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/ModelOrderReduction/releases/tag/release-master) and link them to your SOFA build/binaries.

*PythonPath*
^^^

Then don't forget to add into your pythonPath the sofa launcher.
To do that in a definitive way add this line at the end of your shell configuration file (usually *.bashrc*)

```console
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/PathToYourSofaSrcFolder/tools/sofa-launcher
```

## Try some exemples

To confirm all the previous steps and verify that the plugin is working properly you can launch the *test_component.py* SOFA scene situated in:

```
/ModelOrderReduction/tools
```

This example show that after the reduction of a model (here the 2 examples {doc}`Diamond Robot </usage/examples/Diamond/diamond>`,
{doc}`Starfish robot </usage/examples/Starfish/starfish>`), you can re-use it easily as a python object with different arguments 
allowing positionning of the model in the SOFA scene.
